     <!-- Answer: -->

     <!-- void elements, also known as self-closing or empty elements, these elements that don't have a closing tag. They represent standalone content and cannot have any content or child elements. Void elements are usually used for embedding media, line breaks, or other self-contained elements. -->

     <!-- Examples: -->

     <!-- Example 1 -->
          <img src="example.jpg" alt="Example Image"> 
     <!-- img tag is used to put images in webpage this is void element and src & alt are its attributes -->

     <!-- Example 2: -->
     <p>This is some text.<br>Here is a new line.</p>
