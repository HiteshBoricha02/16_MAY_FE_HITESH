     <!-- Question 5 -->

     <!-- Answer: -->
     <!-- HTML entities are special codes used to represent characters that have a special meaning in HTML. also html entities are those type of characters that we cant easily type on keyboard or in simple way we can say that they are reserve keywords of HTML here are some of examples of HTML entities -->

     <!-- Example 1 -->
     <p>This is an example of the less than sign: 5 &lt; 10</p>
     <!-- &lt entity presents the less than sign it is quite useful if in some kind of information where we have to use less than sign then this entity is very useful becuase we cant simply create an less than type from usng keyborad icon becuase HTML use less than sign for tags. -->

     <!-- Example 2: -->
     <p>This an example of &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; this is example</p>
     <!-- in HTML there is only one tag that count every space that we make and the name of that tag is <pre></pre> tag but we cant use that tag often becuse its provides on style for text so its not preferable to use that tag oftenly thats why we used &nbsp entity it considers as one space so if we write &nbsp 10 times then it considers 10 space and we can use that in every tag that will use for write content but its not professional to use this entity. -->
