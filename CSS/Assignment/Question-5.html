   <h1>What do you understand by CSS opacity?</h1>

   <div>CSS opacity refers to how transparent or see-through an element on a web page is. It's like adjusting the transparency of a piece of paper. In simple language:</div>
   <div>If you set the opacity of an element to 1 (the default), it's completely opaque, which means you can't see through it at all.</div>
   <div>If you set the opacity to a value less than 1, like 0.5, the element becomes partially </div>
