    <h2> â€¢ What is the difference between a block-level element and an inline element? </h2>
    <br> <br>
    <h3>

        elements are two  type&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;:&nbsp;&nbsp; 1) block Level &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  2) Inline
        <br><br><br>
        1) Block Level&nbsp;&nbsp;:
        <br><br>
        Block-level elements start on a new line and take up the full available width by default.
They create a "block" of content and typically represent structural elements in the document, such as paragraphs, headings, dividers, lists, and sections.
Examples of block-level elements include &lt;p&gt;, &lt;div&gt;, &lt;h1&gt; to &lt;h6&gt;, &lt;ul&gt;, &lt;ol&gt;, and &lt;section&gt;.
Block-level elements can contain other block-level and inline elements.
They can have their width, height, margins, padding, and other CSS properties adjust
<br><br>
        2) Inline elements&nbsp;&nbsp;:
        <br><br>
        Inline elements do not start on a new line; they flow alongside other elements within the same line.
        They only occupy the space required by their content, without creating line breaks.
        Examples of inline elements include &lt;span&gt;, &lt;a&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;, &lt;em&gt;, &lt;img&gt;, &lt;input&gt;, &lt;label&gt;, and others.
        Inline elements do not have width, height, margins (top/bottom), or paddings (top/bottom) applied to them by default. However, you can adjust horizontal margins and paddings.
